    <h2><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>  
        <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li><b><del>CSS is not neccesary</del> <span>CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once</li>
        <li><u><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2><i>CSS can added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using the style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - By using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>the most common way to add CSS, in to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <b><span>in this<br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br>for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also<br>
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
    <p>
        in CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the<br>element
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied
